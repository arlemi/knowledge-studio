# Creating dictionaries
{: #dictionaries}

Dictionaries help the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} machine annotators to understand the language of the domain.
{: shortdesc}

## Dictionaries
{: #wks_dictionaries}

In machine learning, a dictionary groups together words and phrases that share something in common. An entry in the dictionary does not mean that all words in the entry mean the same thing, but that the words are to be treated equivalently by an annotator component.

A dictionary is a list of words or phrases that are equivalent for information-extraction purposes, meaning that they are interchangeable for the purposes of identifying entity and relation mentions.

Consider this example: a dictionary entry contains the seven days of the week. To annotate a document, a human annotator assigns the entity type DAY_OF_WEEK to mentions of Monday and Friday in the text. Because the dictionary equates the seven days of the week, it helps ensure that a machine annotator correctly annotates occurrences of Tuesday, Wednesday, and the other days of the week in unseen documents at run time. In addition, equating these words also benefits information extraction in surrounding text. What the machine annotator learns from training examples about the texts near Monday and Friday gets applied to texts that the machine annotator sees near other days of the week because the dictionary states that these terms are equivalent for information-extraction purposes.

> **Note:** You do not need to create a dictionary that contains days of the week information; several general-purpose dictionaries like this are built into the application. Others include countries, place names, number words, animals, plants, diseases, measurement words (such as ounce and meter), and salutation title words (such as Mr. and Mrs.). You cannot disable or edit built-in dictionaries.

Avoid adding entries that have multiple meanings. For example, in a domain about auto racing, it makes sense to include the term *bank*, which refers to a road feature, only if financial institutions are not frequently discussed in the text also. If both senses of the word occur often in the source documents, then it is best to leave it out of both types of dictionaries: the dictionary that is associated with road features, and the dictionary that is associated with financial institutions.

You can create dictionaries in {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} by manually adding individual entries. {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} also supports the ability to import several types of dictionary files.

### How are dictionaries used?

Dictionaries are used in a couple ways, all optional. They are used by the machine-learning annotator component to provide words or phrases that are equivalent for information-extraction purposes and during pre-annotation to bootstrap the annotation effort.

- **Machine-learning usage**

    The entity type that you associate with a dictionary is not used to define rules for the machine-learning annotator component. Machine learning evaluates mentions in the documents independently. It does not assume that a mention has a specific entity type just because the mention matches an entry in a dictionary that is associated with that entity type. It does take the information into account, but treats it as one piece of information among other pieces of information that it gathers through linguistic analysis. In fact, if none of the terms in a dictionary occur in the ground truth documents, then the dictionary is not used at all by the machine-learning annotator.

- **Pre-annotation usage**

    Dictionaries are important to the following pre-annotatation processes.
    - Dictionary pre-annotator: You associate a dictionary with an entity type from the type system when you run the dictionary pre-annotator.
    - Rule annotator: You can optionally associate a dictionary with a rule class. Classes are then mapped to entity types from the type system when you run the Rule annotator to pre-annotate documents. As a result, dictionary terms are, although circuitously, mapped to entity types for the Rule annotator also.

    In both cases, the dictionaries provide terms that the system can find and annotate as mentions. It assigns to each mention the entity type that is associated with the dictionary that contains the term. When a human annotator begins work on new documents that were pre-annotated, many mentions are already annotated based on the dictionary entries. The human annotator thus has more time to focus on assigning entity types to mentions that require deeper analysis.

### Language considerations

- For Brazilian Portuguese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish, {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} does not currently provide an option to specify case-insensitive dictionary-matching, but dictionary entries match text that has higher case. For example, "vehicle" in the dictionary matches "vehicle", "Vehicle" or "VEHICLE" in text, while "Sat" in the dictionary matches "Sat" or "SAT" in text, but not "sat".
- For Japanese and Korean, dictionary matching during pre-annotation is case-sensitive.
- For Arabic, {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} assumes that Arabic text is stored unshaped and treats numeric shaping as a storage-level property. For details about how {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} handles Arabic character shaping and numeric shaping, see [Configuring support for Arabic](/docs/services/knowledge-studio/language-support.html#wks_langsupp_ar).

### CSV file dictionary
{: #wks_dictionaries__cvsdict}

Also referred to as the standard dictionary format, a dictionary in comma-separated value (`CSV`) format is a file that you can edit after you import it. The maximum size of a `CSV` file that you can import is 1 MB. If you have a larger dictionary file, then break the large file into multiple files and import them one at a time into a single dictionary in your {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} project.

To summarize the requirements, you must use a text editor to create the `CSV` file, not software like Microsoft Excel, and the file must use UTF-8 encoding that does not include the byte order mark (BOM) at the start of the text stream. The first row in the file must specify the following column headers:

```
lemma,poscode,surface
```
{: screen}

The remaining lines in the file specify the dictionary entries, where:

- **`lemma`**

    Specifies the most representative word form for the entry.

- **`poscode (Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish)`**

    Specifies a code that identifies the part of speech. This part of speech information is used by the dictionary annotator to help with sentence tokenization.
    - 0 - Unknown

        > **Note:** This code supports the scenario where you want to import a large machine-generated dictionary that does not include part of speech information in each entry. You can assign Unknown to all entries by default. Avoid using this code, if possible.

    - 1 - Pronoun
    - 2 - Verb
    - 3 - Noun
    - 4 - Adjective
    - 5 - Adverb
    - 6 - Adposition
    - 7 - Interjection
    - 8 - Conjunction
    - 9 - Determiner
    - 10 - Quantifier

    In English, noun(3), verb(2), and adjective(4) are the most common parts of speech that are used for dictionary entries.

    > **Note:** The part of speech does not automatically determine the type of a mention. Do not assume that all nouns equate to entity type mentions and all verbs equate to relation type mentions. For example, *American* is an adjective but might be best annotated as entity type GPE (geopolitical entity) or PERSON. *Met* is a verb, but might be best annotated as an EVENT_MEETING.

    In other languages, such as German, which uses compound words, the accuracy of the part of speech information is even more important to help determine word boundaries.

- **`poscode (Japanese)`**

    Specifies a code that identifies the part of speech. The part of speech value is important for text tokenization and pre-annotation in languages like Japanese that do not use white space to denote word boundaries.
    - 19 - Noun
    - 23 - Common Prefix
    - 24 - Common Suffix
    - 140 - Proper Noun (Last Name)
    - 141 - Proper Noun (First Name)
    - 146 - Proper Noun (Person Name)
    - 142 - Proper Noun (Organization)
    - 144 - Proper Noun (Place Name)
    - 143 - Proper Noun (Region)
    - 145 - Proper Noun (Other)

- **`poscode (Korean)`**

    Specifies a code that identifies the part of speech. The part of speech value is important for text tokenization and pre-annotation in languages like Korean that do not use white space to denote word boundaries.
    - 10010 - Noun
    - 10300 - Proper Noun (Last Name)
    - 10310 - Proper Noun (First Name)
    - 110360 - Proper Noun (Person Name)
    - 10320 - Proper Noun (Organization)
    - 10340 - Proper Noun (Place Name)
    - 10330 - Proper Noun (Region)
    - 10350 - Proper Noun (Other)

- **`surface`**

    Specifies equivalent terms, also called surface forms. Repeat the lemma as a surface form and use a comma to separate multiple surface forms. If a surface form includes a comma, enclose the surface form in quotation marks.

For example:

```
lemma,poscode,surface
IBM,3,IBM Corp.,IBM,"International Business Machines, Inc."
Department of Energy,3,DOE,Department of Energy
premium,4,premium,premium-grade
```

## Adding dictionaries to a project
{: #wks_projdictionaries}

Adding dictionaries is an optional step in creating an annotator component. Dictionaries are helpful because they enable you to jump start the annotation process.

### About this task

If you provide a dictionary, you can run the dictionary pre-annotator on the documents. The pre-annotator finds terms that are represented in your dictionary and automatically annotates them. This initial pass on the documents simplifies the human annotator's job because she can review the annotations that were added by the pre-annotator and correct them or add to them. She does not have to start entirely from scratch.

To quickly supplement the dictionaries that are used by the project with domain terminology, you can download an industry-specific dictionary from the [{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}® {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}® Analytics Exchange  ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/data/exchange/){: new_window} site. Download the dictionary as a CSV file. The CSV file must be smaller than 1MB. If the file is larger, consider breaking it up into multiple smaller files. You can then create a dictionary, and add the industry terminology by importing the CSV file of dictionary terms that you downloaded.

The following restriction apply to dictionaries:

- Maximum 15,000 entries per dictionary

    > **Note:** This limit does not apply to dictionaries that you import as a dictionary CSV file. Read-only dictionaries can contain more entries.

- Maximum 64 dictionaries per project

### Procedure

To add a dictionary to your project:

1. Log in as a {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} administrator or project manager and open the **Dictionaries** page.
1. Perform one of the following tasks:

    - Click the **Import dictionary** icon to import a dictionary. Associate the dictionary with an entity type, and then click **Import**.

        - You can import a ZIP file that contains a dictionary that you exported from another {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} project. You must import the type system that was exported from the other project in JSON format before you can import the corresponding dictionary file. You can edit and add entries to a dictionary that you reuse from another {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} project. See [Importing resources from another project](/docs/services/knowledge-studio/exportimport.html) for more details.

        Importing a CSV file is also supported, but importing it directly as a dictionary creates a preview-only dictionary that you cannot edit or use to pre-annotate documents. To import a CSV file that you can edit and use for pre-annotation, add the dictionary first, and then import the CSV content as entries.

    - Click the **Add** icon to create a new dictionary to which you can subsequently add dictionary entries.

        Specify a descriptive name for the dictionary, select the entity type that best describes the purpose of the dictionary, and then click **Save**.

1. To add entries to the dictionary, perform one of the following tasks:

    - Click **Add Entry** to add a dictionary entry. Specify the lemma (the most representative word form for the term).
    - Click **Import** to import a `CSV` file that contains dictionary entries, and then browse to select the file. This could be an industry-specific dictionary that you downloaded from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Analytics Exchange , for example. The CSV file must be smaller than 1MB.

1. After importing or adding entries, you can edit the entries.

    Open an entry to specify equivalent terms, called surface forms. Each surface form must be 256 or fewer characters in length. You can change which of the surface forms is used as the lemma.

    For example, the lemma *{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}* might have surface forms like *{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Corp.* and *International Business Machines, Inc.*.

1. Select the appropriate part of speech for each lemma and surface form in the dictionary.

    The part of speech information is used by the tokenizer, and during pre-annotation.

1. Click **Save** to store your changes.

### What to do next

Run the pre-annotator, which uses the dictionaries that you created to do a preliminary pass of the source documents, and adds annotations to them.
